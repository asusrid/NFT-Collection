## NFT Minting Dapp

This application will be using the extension of the standard for NFTs, ERC721 Enumerable, for the blockchain part of the dapp. NextJS will be responsible for the frontend, this allows us to not just have a nice interface but also write some backend code.

There will be a presale minting in which only whitelisted addresses will be able to mint NFTs. On the other hand, there will be also a public minting option in which any address will be able to mint NFTs.

Presales minting has a limited time of 5 mins, after which the whitelisted user will be able only to do a public mint.

This dapp is accessible in the following link:
